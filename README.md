# Autonomous-maze-solver-bot-using-Arduino

The Autonomous Maze Solver Bot is a self-navigating robot designed to explore and solve mazes without human intervention.
The bot is built using an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, and DC motors controlled via a motor driver module.
It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and determine the best path forward.
The control algorithm makes real-time decisions, allowing the bot to move straight, turn left, turn right, or make a U-turn based on its surroundings.
The pathfinding logic ensures the robot reaches the exit efficiently.
This project demonstrates robotics, embedded systems, and autonomous navigation techniques, making it suitable for applications in robotics competitions, automation, and AI-driven navigation systems.
